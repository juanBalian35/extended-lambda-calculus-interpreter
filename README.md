# Extended lambda calculus interpreter

Interpreter of "Chi", a turing complete language that extends lambda calculus. Most notably adds constructors and case constructs, allowing to make use of ML-style pattern matching.

Includes two functions "nnot" and "evenn" written in Chi, being respectively boolean negation and positive integer evenness.
